There are multiple ethical problems that can arise if vulnerabilities are found in an ECU’s firmware. These problems vary in severity depending on the actual vulnerabilities found and how they can be exploited. I am in no way an expert on cars or the ECU’s that control the electronic parts within cars, but I can brainstorm some potential vulnerabilities that could arise in an ECU’s firmware. 
One example could be a glaring oversight in the ECU’s firmware where no error checking is performed if a sensor connected to the ECU were to provide some crazy values that could have been injected by a malicious actor. Let’s say the result of this lack of error correction would prevent the car from shifting gears. In this example the car is almost useless. It can still drive, but it can leave first gear and as a result is very limited in its capabilities. But at the same time, it can still sort of drive and it doesn’t endanger the lives of its occupants (besides possibly stressing them out to the point where they start to suffer health problems). 
The ethics surrounding this scenario can be subjective. The ethical mindset that you should have is to prevent consumers from purchasing and using a product that you know is defective in some way. You should tell your boss about this vulnerability. Depending on how easy this vulnerability is to exploit and depending on how much you trust your boss to handle this issue, you may or may not want to tell the public about this. If your company is unwilling to postpone the release of the ECU, then see if you can try to make certain quick tweaks to the firmware that could help mitigate some aspects of the vulnerability if possible. I personally would have to outweigh the risks and benefits associated with a scenario like this to determine how far I would go. If I went to the public to talk about how the company is releasing the ECU despite its many problems, then I must realize that losing my job is highly likely. I would have to think about whether spilling this information is worth losing my job. If I decided to keep quiet in a situation like this then part of the responsibility could be placed on me. While the majority of the responsibility should be placed on the higher ups who made the executive decision to push the product anyway, I as the auditor, would still hold some responsibility because I had the ability to tell the public about it and chose not to. As far as any legal action is concerned, I don’t believe that I would be at fault because I was pressured by the company to not say anything, but on a ethical level you could say that keeping quiet is not quite ethical.
